    <h1>Our Love Story 💖</h1>
  </header>

<section class="love-letter">
  <h2 id="boy"> Boy's view <span style="font-size:1.2em;">💗</span></h2>

 <p>
    Our first meeting was online. The very first time I saw her, I thought she looked a bit *jada* (a Malayalam term for someone who acts too proud). We were studying in 6th standard back then, in 2021. That year passed without us even speaking once. But I messaged hii and she says that I am the first person who sends a message to her from our school. And My love studied till 1 STD in Little Daffodils School, later she went to aboad and came back in 6 STD <br><br>
    
    Then came 2022 — we entered 7th standard. We weren't exactly friends, but we had a playful connection. We would throw chalk pieces at each other just for fun , though it wasn't exactly friendly at the time. She had a short-lived two-way love with someone else, but it ended quickly for various reasons. After that, we started talking more and slowly became good friends. 💬<br><br>
    
    One day, I found a funny photo of her — she was plucking plants. I got that photo from my mother’s phone (she’s a teacher), because my love's brother was my mom’s student. On Gandhi Jayanti, all the students were asked to submit a photo of them planting or cleaning something. And there she was in one of those pics. I kept it private but made fun of her with it sometimes. 😄🌿<br><br>
    
    In 8th standard, many of her friends left the school, so we got even closer. We went on an excursion together, and I sang many songs for her. It was during that time I started to develop feelings. 💖 I even created a secret language — the cringiest thing ever 😅 — in which “I love you” was translated as “hukalprkshomnave.” I told her that word, and even though she didn’t know what it meant, she said it back to me. I had told one of my friends what it meant, and he told her. Apparently, she cried... I was scared. 😔 But luckily, she wasn’t mad. She just rejected me. Still, I didn’t stop trying — we stayed friends. 🤝<br><br>
    
    In 9th standard, we continued being friends. We followed each other on Starmaker and started messaging — not a lot, mostly on WhatsApp using her mom’s phone. Near the end of 9th, a new Starmaker update came with a Truth or Dare feature. We played it and shared many secrets. We trusted each other so much. 💬❤️<br><br>
    
    We went on another excursion to Ernakulam. She sat in front of me on the bus, and although she was sleeping, I sang many songs for her. 🎶 There was one more Talrop excursion to Mavoor Village Park too. We became thick friends — super close. Then 10th standard began, and special classes started in April. We kept fighting and teasing each other for fun. I had fallen deeply, madly in love with her. 😍<br><br>
    
    Then, on May 5, 2025, she sent me a set of questions. One of them was: "If I kiss you, what will you do — hold me tight or push me away?" I said “hold you tight.” I asked the same question back, and she replied the same. Then she asked (or maybe I asked, I don’t remember) — "What color heart will you give me? ❤️ for love, 💚 for best friend," and I gave her a red heart. She sent one back. When I asked her about our relationship status, she said she wasn’t sure. After a long conversation, she finally confessed she loves me — but that we can only be in a relationship after 10th class ends. I agreed. 💑<br><br>
    
    Now, we act like we're already in a relationship. She's really possessive — if I talk to another girl, she gets angry 😡. And yes, I tease her intentionally just to see that reaction. But now… we’re lovers. Even if we’re not officially together yet, we’re more than that. She’s my babyyyy 💕😘

 <p>
    Like the K-Dramas I watch, the most unexpected person turned out to be my prince ❤. It all started when we were in 6th standard, during online classes because of COVID. My first class at Little Daffodils School was English. I still remember — Divya Miss was my class teacher. Just as she began introducing me, the power went out at my uncle’s house, so I couldn't even introduce myself. That was our first "meeting", though we had no idea it would someday become a turning point in our lives. 💫<br><br>
    
    Since everything was online, we didn’t know each other very well. But he was the first one to message me — a simple “hii” on WhatsApp — and I replied with a sticker 😄. We didn't talk much, only messaging when we needed notes. A whole year passed just like that. In 7th grade, we still didn’t talk much, but we started teasing each other for fun. He was really, really naughty back then 😜. I liked his naughtiness, but only as a friend. He used to playfully hit me and run through the corridors, and I’d run behind him trying to get my revenge 😆. It was all innocent and fun — until another twist arrived. <br><br>
    
    A guy from my class proposed to me. I could tell he had feelings, even before he said anything. He eventually gave me love letters and stayed close to me all year. I thought he was "the one", but later realized it was a big mistake. After some issues, I started to hate him. He made my life miserable — he told all the boys in class not to talk to me, and even my closest guy friends stayed away when he was around. I was going through a really tough time 💔. Even when we started talking again, things never got better. That’s when I stopped believing in love. I hated hearing the word when it came to my own life. I couldn’t even listen to romantic songs or watch love stories anymore…<br><br>
    
    But everything changed the next year — all because of that one guy who brought back the meaning of love for me. There came my boy 💝, my kuttuchan 💞. In 8th standard, I started noticing him more — the way he looked at me, the way he started developing feelings. ☺ I could sense it. But because of what I'd been through, I couldn’t bring myself to see him as anything more than a friend. <br><br>
    
    He even made his own secret language 😅! In that, “I love you” was “hukalprikishomnavae”. Even though I didn’t know the meaning at first, I could feel it — from his tone, his eyes, his smile. And honestly? I loved it. It was so cute and genuine 💗. Later, a friend of ours told me what it meant and asked me if I loved him back. I pretended not to know anything… but after school that day, I saw him sitting in a corner, looking like he was crying. I went up to him and said, “It’s okay, don’t worry,” and asked him if he really loved me — more than 6 times. He nodded every single time 🥹.<br><br>
    
    That year became one of the best parts of my life 💖. He sang many songs just for me 🎤, and during our class tour, we grew even closer. Then came 9th standard — we became inseparable. I installed the app “Starmaker” (he already had it), and it brought such a beautiful change in our bond. We shared reels, jokes, voice messages, questions — everything. We really got to know each other deeply. 💌<br><br>
    
    In 10th standard, our love story truly began. While playing some fun “get to know each other” questions, one of them was about love. He said “yes”, and I — although hesitant at first — replied the same. I wasn’t sure about my feelings at that moment, but later I realized… I did love him. ❤️<br><br>
    
    And then, on 5th May 2025, he asked me: “What’s our relationship status?” I replied, “I don’t know,” but later that day, I opened up. I told him we’d officially start our relationship after 10th. That day… our journey began 🥰.<br><br>
    
    Now, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world to have my babyyy. He’s my everything. I honestly can’t imagine a life without him. I love how he cares about the little things 🫶. I know — without a doubt — he’ll be a gentleman and take care of me forever. I wish that we grow together — from school days to our grey-haired days. Love you, my man ❤😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
